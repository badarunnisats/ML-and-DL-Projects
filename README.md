- Discrete random variable
- continuous random variable
- probability density function
- mean,median,mode,Standarddeviation
- correlation
- correlation coefficient
- Testing of hypothesis

# 2. Introduction to Machine Learning

- Machine learning concepts and applications
- Overview of Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement learning
- Exploring common machine learning algorithms
3. Data Preprocessing for
Machine Learning
Types of Data: Categorical and
Numerical Data, Understanding
data preprocessing and its
importance in machine learning,
Handling missing data, outliers,
and categorical variables, Label
Encoding, Feature scaling and
normalization techniques.Python
Library: Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn
4. Project
Use a dataset then remove NaN
values and apply label encoder
and scaling methods.
